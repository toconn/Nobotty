3 day build (August 2nd to 4th)



### Day 1 

* Start with nothing.
* Goal: Figure out how to build a bot.

* Understand nuts and bolts.
* Send a message.
* Receive a message.

Ended up with a fully functioning interactive bot. How did that happen?


### Day 2

* Make a proper app.
* Add lots of fun things.
* Bait friends' curiosity to check out fun easter eggs.
* Promptly get ignored.


### Day 3

* Deploy to Raspberry Pi.
* Automate deployment.
* Make proper server app with logs and settings.
* Add more fun things.
* Bait friends' curiosity again to check out easter eggs.
* Promptly get ignored.
* Put code on Github.


Done!


### After

Well, you just can't leave things alone and this has become a monster. I made a dozen updates just the day after. I get more and more ideas!
